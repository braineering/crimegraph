\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The data-driven fight against the organized crime is opening new research challenges and directions. 
In this context it is necessary to develop innovative topological models, natively thought for big data analytics technologies.
In this work we proposed two metrics for link detection and link prediction together with their data stream processing implementation. 

The experimental results show that the proposed metrics can reach up to ??\% accuracy with an average latency of ?? ms.
