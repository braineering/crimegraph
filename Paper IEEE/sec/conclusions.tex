\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The data-driven fight against the organized crime is opening new research challenges and directions. 
In this context it is necessary to develop innovative topological models, natively thought for big data analytics technologies.
In this work we proposed three new metrics for link detection and prediction, together with a data stream processing architecture able to both classical and new metrics.

The experiments are aimed at comparing classical similarity metrics with the proposed ones in detecting and predicting criminal patterns. The experimental results show that the new metrics we propose can reach up to \hlr{??\%} accuracy in detection, and \hlr{??\%} accuracy in prediction.
