Big data analytics can disruptively reshape core tasks of security intelligence.
The real-time discovery of hidden criminal patterns is an outstanding challenge for security and law enforcement agencies.
In particular, predicting the evolution of criminal networks and uncovering concealed relationships can efficiently guide investigations for better decision-making. 

In this context, it is necessary to model social network metrics that are both domain-aware and ready to be executed in a data stream environment. 
That is why we propose three new metrics for criminal link detection and prediction, together with their data stream processing implementation.

Furthermore, determining the best metric for specific criminal datasets is not a straightforward task. For this reason we propose a flexible data stream processing architecture, that makes really easy to deploy and analyze any metric.

The experiments are aimed at comparing classical metrics with the proposed ones in detecting and predicting criminal patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed metrics can reach up to ??\% accuracy in detection, and ??\% accuracy in prediction.
