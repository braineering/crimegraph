Big data analytics is a disruptive technology that can reshape core tasks of security intelligence.
The real-time discovery of hidden criminal patterns is an outstanding challenge for security and law enforcement agencies.
In particular, predicting the evolution of criminal networks and uncovering concealed relationships can efficiently guide investigations for better decision-making. 

In this context, it is necessary to develop social network metrics that are both domain-aware and ready to be executed in a data stream environment. 
That is why we propose two metrics for criminal link detection and prediction, together with their data stream processing implementation.

Furthermore, determining the best metric for specific criminal patterns is not a straightforward task. For this reason we propose a flexible data stream processing architecture, making it suitable to develop, deploy and compare any metric with great ease.

The experimental results show that the proposed metrics can reach up to ??\% accuracy in prediction, and ??\% accuracy in detection.
