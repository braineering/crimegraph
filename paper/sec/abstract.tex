The real-time discovery of hidden patterns in criminal networks is critical for investigative activities.
In particular, predicting the evolution of criminal networks and identifying inner hidden relationships may significantly speed up and orient investigations.
In this context it is necessary to develop big data analytics systems that leverage criminological assumptions, techniques of social network analysis and data stream processing technologies.

In this work, we propose two structural local metrics for link detection/prediction and a data stream processing architecture to deploy them, leveraging Flink and Neo4j.
The experimental results show that the proposed metrics can reach up to 80\% accuracy with an average latency of 1 second.
