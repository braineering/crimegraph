In this paper we propose local metrics for descriptive links detection and prediction in criminal networks.
These metrics are ready for a data stream processing environment. 

Criminal network analysis can leverages data stream processing technologies to succeed. In fact, it requires the integration of multiple data sources to timely discover hidden patterns about the organization, operation and information flow in large and complex crime data \cite{xu2005criminal}.


We show the on-line algorithm that 

The experimental results show that, the proposed metrics have an accuracy of ....
