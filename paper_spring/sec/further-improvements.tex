\section{Further improvements}
\label{sec:further-improvements}

The criminological assumptions underlying the link detection metrics are in line with the studies on traffic matrix exstimation on IP networks \cite{medina2002traffic,benameur2004traffic,papagiannaki2004distributed}. 
In fact, there could be an hidden link between two nodes, if the traffic matrix identifies a strict correlation between the outgoing and ingoing traffic from on another. The correlation could be detected by the traffic matrix decomposition techniques \cite{elgamal2015analysis,jiang2015covariance}.
Is currently limited the literature on the implementation of data stream processing algorithms for the decomposition of sparse matrices.

The proposed metrics do not address the link mining on criminal networks composed by distinct connected components. Statistical analysis and inference on traffic matrices would make it possible.
